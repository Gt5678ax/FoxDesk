[![FoxDesk self-hosted dashboard with client work and recorded time](docs/screenshots/dashboard-light.png)](docs/screenshots/dashboard-light.png)

FoxDesk keeps the request, its owner, the work performed, and the client report in one record. A client can write by email or through the portal. Your team assigns the ticket, records time beside the work, and shares a report without rebuilding the month from inboxes and spreadsheets.

It runs on ordinary PHP hosting or a VPS. There is no per-agent fee, no hosted dependency, and no requirement to send client data to FoxDesk Cloud.

## The workflow

| 1. Receive | 2. Take ownership | 3. Record work | 4. Report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turn portal and email requests into tickets with their full context. | Assign an owner, priority, due date, status, and client organization. | Use a timer or an exact manual entry. Keep every note beside the ticket. | Review real time, rates, and completed work before sharing or exporting. |

## Choose how to run FoxDesk

## Connect coding agents and automations

FoxDesk exposes scoped bearer-token endpoints for ticket lookup and creation, status changes, comments, and time entries. A connected coding agent can report completed work to the correct client ticket instead of leaving the useful result inside a closed thread.

The repository includes:

- [Agent API quick start](docs/AGENT_API_QUICKSTART.md)
- [MCP server setup for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and compatible clients](docs/AGENT_MCP_SERVER.md)
- [Example MCP implementation](examples/agent-api/README.md)
- [Permission and operating guidance](docs/AGENT_API_CONTROL.md)

Tokens inherit the creating user's permissions and can be limited by capability. Do not paste production tokens into prompts, issues, or logs.

## Current release

The latest packaged version is [FoxDesk 0.3.140](https://github.com/lukashanes/foxdesk/releases/tag/v0.3.140), published on August 18, 2026.

It makes client companies the primary Clients view, separates companies from portal contacts, improves narrow-screen administration, and retains the Microsoft 365 mail, reporting, security, and 24-locale work delivered in 0.3.139.

Use the in-app updater or download the release assets from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lukashanes/foxdesk/releases). Every release includes upgrade notes, rollback guidance, a manifest, and SHA-256 evidence.

## Development

FoxDesk uses PHP without a backend framework, MySQL or MariaDB, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, and a custom token-based UI system.

## Repository scope

This repository is the public release channel for the self-hosted edition. Contributions should improve self-hosted installation, security, local email, ticket and reporting workflows, API integrations, translations, updates, or recovery.

FoxDesk Cloud billing, subscription trials, tenant lifecycle, managed storage, operator administration, and platform deployment are commercial service modules. They are intentionally not published here. The self-hosted reporting rates in this repository are client-work features, not FoxDesk subscription billing.
